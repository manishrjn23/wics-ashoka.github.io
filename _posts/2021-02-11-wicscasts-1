Wish you all a very happy International Day of Women and Girls in Science! On this special day, we are extremely delighted to launch WiCS' first podcast series, WiCSCast: From Runtimes to Fun Times. 

In the podcast episodes, we will attempt to bring together researchers, professors, and students in the CS field to break down seemingly complex and lesser-known topics in Computer Science and related disciplines. Through this medium, we also hope to give rise to more conversations pertaining to gender and its role in academia and other professional domains, especially in the STEM fields. 

For the first episode, we have Chanda Grover, a Computer Science PhD student at Ashoka University, break down **Transfer Learning**, her area of interest in Machine Learning.
