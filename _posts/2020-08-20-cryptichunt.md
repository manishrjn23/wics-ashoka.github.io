Hello! This post contains instructional pointers for people who wish to participate in WiCS' Cryptic Hunt 2020: Waterboarded Witless. 

* There will be 14 levels in all. 
* You have infinite number of tries for each questions. However, please note that only the right answer will take you to the next level.
* Your answers should be in all lowercase alphabets or numbers (no spaces or special characters). Please keep this in mind - we don't want you to be at a disadvantage merely because of the format of your answer.
* You can participate individually or in teams of two. 
* Please fill the form that has been sent to you with the information about you (and the other team member, if any) so that we know your team. In this form, you will have to tell us the Ashoka ID that you will be using for the team and the username for your team. 
* Regarding the point above, please note that:
	* Each team must have a team name or username. 
	* The username should have only lowercase alphabets or numbers. No spaces or special characters will be allowed. For example, "covid19" is an acceptable username, while these are not acceptable: "Covid19", "Covid 19", "Covid-19". 
	* Each team can use only one Ashoka email ID (the one that you will mention on the form). If your team has two members, you cannot login with both your email IDs. Doing so can result in disqualification from the hunt. 
* The credits for making the cryptic hunt portal go to Onish Garg from the Batch of 2021.
* Lastly, remember to have fun!
