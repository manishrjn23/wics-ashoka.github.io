Hello! This post contains instructional pointers for people who wish to participate in WiCS' Cryptic Hunt 2020: Waterboarded Witless. 


1. **This hunt is only open to Ashoka University students. All the members in your team should be currently enrolled in Ashoka University as a student.**
1. There will be 14 levels in all. 
1. You have infinite number of tries for each questions. However, please note that only the right answer will take you to the next level.
1. Your answers should be in all lowercase alphabets or numbers (no spaces or special characters). Please keep this in mind - we don't want you to be at a disadvantage merely because of the format of your answer.
1. You can participate individually or in teams of two. 
1. Please fill in your queries/doubts regarding the portal/questions on the portal in [this form](https://forms.gle/uuGD3B8CqJeEadNy8). This form has been created so that we can respond to your queries in a more efficient manner, since emails can get lost sometimes. We will try to respond to you as soon as possible. Having said that, please note that we will not entertain questions about questions from the cryptic hunt that are emailed to wics@ashoka.edu.in. This form will be active only between Saturday, 12 PM and Sunday 11:59 PM.
1. Please fill the form that has been sent to you with the information about you (and the other team member, if any) so that we know your team. In this form, you will have to tell us the Ashoka ID that you will be using for the team and the username for your team. 
1. Regarding the point above, please note that:
	1. Each team must have a team name or username. 
	1. The username should have only lowercase alphabets or numbers. No spaces or special characters will be allowed. For example, "covid19" is an acceptable username, while these are not acceptable: "Covid19", "Covid 19", "Covid-19". 
	1. Each team can use only one Ashoka email ID (the one that you will mention on the form). If your team has two members, you cannot login with both your email IDs. Doing so can result in disqualification from the hunt. 
1. Lastly, remember to have fun!

We want to acknowledge Onish Garg from the Batch of 2021 for creating the cryptic hunt portal, and thus making this possible.

But what’s a cryptic hunt?
* A cryptic hunt is an online quiz that is broken down into levels of increasing difficulty (if we’re kind). Each level has a picture or text clue that you have to solve! 
* Right answers entered in the text box take you to the next level. 
* You can attempt the question any number of times, but only the right answer will lead you to the next level. 
* You can participate individually or in teams of two. However, you cannot register twice or switch between individual/team participation without informing us a priori.
* Registration is open to everyone regardless of their major or gender. 
* No technical background will be assumed. If you know how to Google to get information, you should be fine.
