<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Our mission at WICS is to build, support, encourage and strengthen the community of women in CS. Our major goals:
<ul> 
<li>To ensure that women entering the University see Computer Science as a viable Alternative.</li>
<li>To encourage and support academic and professional development of women already pursuing CS.</li>
<li>To guide and aspire high school girls for Computer Science.</li>
<li>To connect and collaborate with a larger community of women in CS and engage in activities that go beyond the University.</li>
</ul>
